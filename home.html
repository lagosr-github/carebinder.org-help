<p>CareBinder.org is a digital care binder, used by caregivers of special needs individuals to organize essential information about the care of that individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A CareBinder is made up of one or more Folders, each folder can contain</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Communications with those Contacts</li>
  <li>Documents</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I built CareBinder.org because I found myself unable to keep up with the paperwork from all the different people and organizations that we deal with for my son's disability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few things I will strive to make sure are always true</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free or low cost. &nbsp;We make use of some Google Cloud services for safe storage of documents and cryptographic material.</li>
  <li>No data or derived data from usage will ever be used to generate income (no ads, no selling of any data).</li>
  <li>Strong security for the stored documents and data.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service is provided for the community, free of charge (at this time), by carebinder.org LLC, an organization created so that this application can provide this service for a long time.</p>
